      # HARD release cleanup
      # ⚠️ DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION
      #
      # - Deletes ALL GitHub releases
      # - Deletes ALL associated Git tags
      # - Intended for full repository reset
      # =================================================

      # =================================================
      # HARD workflow runs cleanup
      # ⚠️ DESTRUCTIVE OPERATION
      #

      # - Deletes all older runs across all workflows
      # - Useful for freeing Actions storage quickly
